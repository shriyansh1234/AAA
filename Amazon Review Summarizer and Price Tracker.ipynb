      " For $10, you get five notebooks in purple, blue, green, golden yellow, and pink, each containing 30 pages (=60 pages front and back). One might say they're expensive, given that you can easily buy a composition book for 50 cents during back-to-school sales, but I just adore how slim these notebooks are, and the quality of the paper is amazing. Except for the very first and last pages, the notebooks open to a relatively flat position, or at least flatter than a composition book can open up.I was initially hesitant to buy these books because of how little pages each notebook has, but I jumped for it when I realized I have trouble finishing a standard composition book. So maybe I'd recommend buying other items to be shipped with your notebooks?Since using this textbook in class, I've found that, for me, a chapter's worth of notes in my economics class takes up only one page (front and back). I'm thinking of buying the 6mm notebooks simply because I'd like the extra lines per page, but these are really good if you like writing with college-ruled paper. I love this notebook so much I recommend getting liquid ink roll ball pens with this it will go perfectly with these  notebooks I’m telling you that right now and this is a great notebook for language writing I highly recommend :) okay so right off the bat, these things are thin !! I love this paper ever since my best friend introduced Japanese Notebooks to me in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. I have been using kokuyo campus notebooks for 2 years now and this school year u decided to go with the A size, it's so far good and paper quality is the same.\n"
